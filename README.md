# Hybrid-Cryptography
This is my group's Hybrid cryptography project from the second year Mathematical Programming unit on the BSc Maths course at the University of Bristol. 
The project explores Caesar and Vigenere ciphers, RSA encription and bigram encoding, and makes attempts at cracking/deciphering these devices with letter frequency analysis.
